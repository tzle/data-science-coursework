# SOURCE STUDY DESIGN
The study is completely described in the README file downloaded with the data.


# -----------------------------------------------
# DATA PROCESSING as written in RUN_ANALYSIS.R

# STEP 1: LOAD FEATURE DATA, THESE ARE THE COLUMN NAMES
# STEP 2: CONVERT FEATURES TO VECTOR & VERIFY THE RESULT
# STEP 3: LOAD THE TRAINING DATA & TEST DATA INTO SEPARATE TABLES
# STEP 4: ATTACH COLUMN NAMES & EXAMINE RESULTS
# STEP 5: LOAD EXERCISE IDENTIFIERS & EXAMINE
# STEP 6: ADD COLUMN OF EXERCISE IDS FROM THE YDATA
#         EXAMINE VALUE DISTRIBUTION OF EXERCISE VALUES
# STEP 7: REPLACE EXERCISE IDS WITH DESCRIPTIVE TEXT FOR BOTH TEST & TRAIN DATA
#         EXAMINE RESULTS
# STEP 8: LOAD SUBJECT ID DATA
#         THESE ARE THE NUMERIC IDENTIFIERS OF THE PARTICIPANTS, 1-30
#         ADD COLUMN OF SUBJECT ID TO XTRAIN
# STEP 9: CREATE VECTORS OF FIELDS TO KEEP
#         MANAGE OBJECTS IN MEMORY
# STEP 10: REDUCE COLUMNS TO MEAN, STD, EXERCISE & SUBJECTID
#         AND VERIFY RESULTS
# STEP 11: CLEAN THE COLUMN NAMES, REMOVE NON-R COMPLIANT CHARACTERS
# STEP 12: COMBINE XTRAIN & XTEST, THEN EXAMINE
#         PREFIX SUBJECTID FIELD WITH CHARACTER
# STEP 13: RESHAPE MERGED
#         MANAGE OBJECTS IN MEMORY
# STEP: 14 OUTPUT AS TEXT FILE
